How to untie a program from the global filesystem:
* No CWD
* No `..`
* No root
* All paths only from env vars or command arguments (preferably the former, it's just a little more convenient for reuse and already has names), only appending to paths gotten that way (like "${CONFIG_PATH}/env_vars.env" or just "${CONFIG_PATH}", NEVER "/somepath/${VARPATH}" - breaks incapsulation)

* All binaries are functions (like plain C functions, i.e. with no context attached, no globals as well)
* All files are arguments (directories included, that is, every file, really)
* All paths are refences
